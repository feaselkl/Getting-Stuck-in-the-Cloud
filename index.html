					<h3>What is the Cloud?</h3>
					
					<p>"The cloud" is simply a term describing a network of servers.  There are four common types of cloud:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Public cloud:  services provided to the general public over the Internet.</li>
						<li>Private cloud:  services provided on a private internal network.  Typically on-premises.</li>
						<li>Hybrid cloud:  services shared between public and private clouds.</li>
						<li>Community cloud:  services and resources shared between distinct organizations.</li>
					</ul>

				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/blue-skies.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>What is Azure?</h3>
					
					<p>Azure is Microsoft's cloud offering.  Microsoft provides a variety of services in Azure, ranging from virtual machine that you control all the way to software products like Microsoft Office.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Who are the Competitors?</h3>
					
					<p>There are two key players:  Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure.  Google and Alibaba are second-tier, and a variety of third-tier providers (IBM, Oracle, Tencent) follow.</p>

					<h3>Key Questions to Ask</h3>
					
					<p>Here are several key questions you should ask yourself to determine whether you should investigate migrating into the cloud, and if so, to what extent.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/target.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Key Questions to Ask</h3>
					
					<p><strong>1)  What is your goal?</strong></p>
					
					<p>There are several viable goals for a cloud migration, such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Reducing costs</li>
						<li>Improving performance</li>
						<li>Improving scalability</li>
						<li>Reducing administration work</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Note that these goals might be in tension with one another, so you may need to rank priorities.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/ram.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Key Questions to Ask</h3>
					
					<p><strong>2)  What is your current infrastructure?</strong></p>
					
					<p>Keeping your current infrastructure will act as the opportunity cost of moving to the cloud.  Considerations include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Do you own your own data center, are you renting space, or do you keep servers in a closet somewhere?</li>
						<li>What are your current data center costs?</li>
						<li>Is your hardware near end-of-life?</li>
						<li>Is your hardware slow for the workloads you expect?</li>
						<li>Are you running close to the limit on those machines?  Or maybe they're way overpowered?</li>
					</ul>

				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/magnifying-glass.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Key Questions to Ask</h3>
					
					<p><strong>3)  What is your plan?</strong></p>
					
					<p>Which of the following makes the most sense to you?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>I want my company to be cloud-only--I do not want any on-premises servers.</li>
						<li>I want my company to be cloud-first--new solutions should be biased toward the cloud, but we recognize some products need to stay on-premises.</li>
						<li>I want a hybrid approach of cloud and on-premises.  Some solutions or servers should remain on-premises and some solutions or servers should go into the cloud.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/lego-instructions.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Key Questions to Ask</h3>
					
					<p><strong>4)  How much cloud experience do you have?</strong></p>
					
					<p>Key considerations here include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>How many developers or architects have relevant cloud experience?</li>
						<li>How many operations personnel have relevant cloud experience?</li>
						<li>What is your strategy to get this experience?</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Hiring is a possible strategy for building up skills.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/cloud.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Hiring for the Cloud</h3>
					
					<p>Which of the following best suits your needs?</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Consultant</li>
						<li>Contractor</li>
						<li>Full-time employee</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/challenge.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Hiring for the Cloud -- Consultants</h3>
					
					<p>Bring in consultants under the following circumstances:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>You want to figure out if a cloud is right for you, or if so, how to maximize value.</li>
						<li>You want to build up the skills of existing employees (FTE or contract).</li>
						<li>You expect knowledge transfer or over-the-shoulder work rather than hands-on operation.</li>
						<li>You are interested in a proof of concept or an architectural design for a pilot.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Consultants are guides but won't carry you up the mountain.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/table.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Hiring for the Cloud -- Contractors</h3>
					
					<p>Bring in contractors under the following circumstances:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>You are interested in a pilot.</li>
						<li>You have some employees with cloud experience but need temporary staff augmentation as others get skilled up.</li>
						<li>You want somebody to check over the work you have done and make modifications as desired.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Contractors fill empty seats quickly and can help skill up employees, but they won't be there forever.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/shoes.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Hiring for the Cloud -- Full-Time Employees</h3>
					
					<p>Bring in full-time employees under the following circumstances:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>You are interested in developing a full product implementation.</li>
						<li>You have few or no current employees with relevant cloud experience.</li>
						<li>You have a good hiring process in place, especially if you don't currently have those skills on your team!</li>
						<li>You are okay with taking "the long view" with employees and build up skill over time.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>You'll need cloud-proficient full-time employees over time; consultants and contractors aren't enough.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/pears.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Hiring for the Cloud -- Full-Time Employees</h3>
					
					<p><strong>Augment or Replace?</strong></p>
					
					<p>Can you invest in your current employees?  Hopefully so!</p>
					
					<p>Augment whenever possible.  Cloud migrations aren't overnight and most skills are still relevant post-migration.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/problem.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Hiring for the Cloud -- Who?</h3>
					
					<p>One myth of hiring for the cloud is the idea that you can get rid of administrators.  This is <strong>not</strong> true!  In the cloud, these people:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Deal with Active Directory (e.g., Azure Active Directory)</li>
						<li>Own and manage virtual machines</li>
						<li>Configure the network, including links from on-premises to the cloud</li>
						<li>Manage and apply network security rules</li>
						<li>Configure and manage virtual private networks (VPNs)</li>
						<li>Deploy, monitor, and manage cloud-based services</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/sound-mixer.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Hiring for the Cloud -- Mixed Ops</h3>
					
					<p>The type of administrator who thrives in the cloud engages in "mixed" ops:  DevOps, DataOps, MLOps, etc.  This means:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Infrastructure as code:  scripting or programming</li>
						<li>Deploy assets programmatically rather than through the web interface</li>
						<li>Use source control and create build processes</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>As a bonus, ops people have a clear signal for improvements:  saving money by optimizing queries or handling load more efficiently.</p>

				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/clouds-sunrise.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Scaling in the Cloud -- The Dream</h3>
					
					<p>Technical sales personnel for cloud organizations will sell you on limitless scale:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Scale up as you need it and down when you don't--seamlessly!</li>
						<li>Save money by scaling down or even turning off services after hours</li>
						<li>As your company grows, scaling up is as simple as manipulating a slider</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/storm-clouds.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Scaling in the Cloud -- The Reality</h3>
					
					<p>Scalability is real, but it comes with certain costs.</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Downtime typically happens when switching performance tiers, especially for things like database servers.</li>
						<li>Scaling may require a downtime window, and you won't know exactly how long that window will be.</li>
						<li>Scaling has its practical limits.</li>
						<li>Pricing is usually linear with respect to scale.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/philosophy.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Scaling in the Cloud -- The Advice</h3>
					
					<p>The best scalability scenarios are around seasonality, followed by "office hours."</p>
					
					<p>Take a close look at which services can scale without downtime and which require downtime.  Some services, such as web servers, can scale horizontally with no downtime.  Others, like database servers, cannot.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/raspberry-pi.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Serverless Technologies</h3>
					
					<p>Cloud providers can also offer "serverless" products--you don't manage any of the infrastructure, but can execute code.  These can be much less expensive in cases where you'd otherwise use a small percentage of a server's capacity.</p>
					
					<p>Examples of serverless products in Azure include:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Serverless SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics</li>
						<li>Azure SQL Database serverless compute tier</li>
						<li>Azure Functions</li>
